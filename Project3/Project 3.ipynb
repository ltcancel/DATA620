    "The testset had a higher accuracy score than the devtest and the error percentage also decreased. By modifying the features function the expectation is that it will increase the accuracy and lower the error showing us that it is able to make good predictions. I think it is possible to improve on this even more. I would start by modifying the feature method to look at the number of vowels present in the name instead of just a True/False if a vowel exists.
